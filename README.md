## Description
`eclingo` is a solver for epistemic logic programs [[1]](#References) built upon the ASP system [`clingo`](https://github.com/potassco/clingo).  
Currently, `eclingo` can compute world views under the following semantics:
- Gelfond 1991; Gelfond and Przymusinska 1993; Gelfond 1994 (G94) [[2, 3, 4]](#References)

## Dependencies

- `python 3.9.12`
- `clingo 5.5.2` Python module.

## Installation

### Clone

Install the correct version of python and clingo:
```
conda create --name eclingo python=3.9.12
conda activate eclingo
conda install -c potassco/label/dev clingo=5.5.2
```

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/potassco/eclingo.git
git checkout develop
```

### Setup

Change your directory and install `eclingo`:
```
cd eclingo/
pip install .
```

### Test
```
pip install -U pytest
python3 -m pytest
conda install -c mypy
mypy eclingo
```

## Usage


### Input language

`eclingo`'s syntax considers three types of statements:
- [Rules](#rules)
- [Show statements](#show-statements)
- [Constant definitions](#constant-definitions)

#### Rules

`eclingo` accepts rules with the same structure as `clingo` does. Additionally, `eclingo` allows these rules to include subjective literals in their body. These subjective literals are represented using the modal operator **K**, which is represented as `&k{}`. The expression inside the curly braces can be an explicit literal (that is, an atom `A` or its explicit negation `-A`) possibly preceded by default negation, that is represented inside the braces as `not` (alternatively default negation can be represented as `~` for backward compatibility).

> Modal operator **M** is not directly supported but `M q` can be replaced by the construction `not &k{ not q }`.

For example, the epistemic logic program:
```
p <- M q.
```
is written under `eclingo`'s syntax as:
```
p :- not &k{ not q }.
```

#### Show statements
Show statements follow `clingo`'s syntax but, in eclingo, they refer to *subjective atoms*.

For example, the show statement:
```
#show p/1.
```
refers to the subjective atom `&k{p/1}`.
